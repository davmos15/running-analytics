## üì± After Deployment

### Update Strava Settings:
1. Go to https://developers.strava.com/
2. Click on your app
3. Update the "Authorization Callback Domain" to:
   - `your-project-name.web.app` (without https://)

### Set Environment Variables in Firebase:
Since Firebase Hosting only serves static files, for production you'll need to:
1. Use Firebase Functions for API calls, OR
2. Set up a backend service, OR
3. Use the Strava API directly from the frontend (current approach)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The current setup exposes your API keys in the frontend. For production, consider setting up Firebase Functions to hide your secrets.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: firebase"
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools

### "Error: Failed to get Firebase project"
Make sure you're logged in:

```

### Build Errors
Clear cache and reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

### Can't access from mobile
- Make sure you're using the Firebase hosting URL (not localhost)
- Check that your phone has internet connection
- The URL should be: https://your-project-name.web.app
